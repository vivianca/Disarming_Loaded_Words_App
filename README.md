# Disarming Loaded Words App

This repository will hold all collaborative contributions to the Disarming Loaded Words plugin.

Make all edits to the code here to avoid merge conflicts (which abound and are unflagged in the GDocs script editor!). Use the script editor IDE only as a test tool.

## Current status:

The plugin can accurately highlight case-insensitive biased words from our corpus in a Google Docs document and display them along with explanations in the sidebar.

### Wizard of Oz prototype: COMPLETE

### Integrate backend: COMPLETE

## Next steps:
Improved UI features (from user feedback):
- Make words clickable (so that when you click on a word, it shows the insight, and you don't have to go to the side panel)
- Color words a different color if they are inside a quotation
- ~Have different sensitivity levels ("high", "low", "medium")---changes the threshold~ COMPLETE
