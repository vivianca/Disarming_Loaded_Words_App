# Disarming Loaded Words App

This repository will hold all collaborative contributions to the Disarming Loaded Words plugin.

Make all edits to the code here to avoid merge conflicts (which abound and are unflagged in the GDocs script editor!). Use the script editor IDE only as a test tool.

## Next steps:

### Wizard of Oz prototype:
- handle case of multiple biased words in a row
- handle capital/lowercase regex

### [on completion of backend API] Integrate backend
