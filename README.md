# Disarming Loaded Words App

This repository will hold all collaborative contributions to the Disarming Loaded Words plugin.

Make all edits to the code here to avoid merge conflicts (which abound and are unflagged in the GDocs script editor!). Use the script editor IDE only as a test tool.

## Current status:

The plugin can accurately highlight case-insensitive biased words from our corpus in a Google Docs document and display them along with explanations in the sidebar.

## Next steps:

### Wizard of Oz prototype:
- Improve sidebar
	- Beautify collected words & explanations

### [on completion of backend API] Integrate backend
